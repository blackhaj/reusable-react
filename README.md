# Reusable React
A ongoing project where I intend to add reusable components and hooks

## Components
`<AutoComplete />` - an input field that uses a Trie to provide rapid autocomplete suggestiong

## Hook
`useHover` - a hook that returns a boolean when the referenced component is being hovered over
